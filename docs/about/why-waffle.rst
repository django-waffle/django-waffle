Why Waffle?
===========

`Feature flags`_ are a critical tool for continuously integrating and
deploying applications. Waffle is one of `several options`_ for managing
feature flags in Django applications.

Waffle :ref:`aims to <about-goals>`

- provide a simple, intuitive API everywhere in your application;
- cover common use cases with batteries-included;
- be simple to install and manage;
- be fast and robust enough to use in production; and
- minimize dependencies and complexity.

Waffle has an `active community`_ and gets `fairly steady updates`_.
